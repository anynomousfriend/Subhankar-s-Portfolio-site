          I’m a finance student turned design professional with 3 years of
          experience, now expanding my skillset as a developer and passionate
          Linux user (arch btw). I previously worked as a UI/UX designer at a
          leading company, where I successfully delivered 16+ projects spanning
          web3, DeFi, and healthcare sectors. In addition, I’ve completed 5
          independent design projects as a freelancer, honing my creative and
          problem-solving abilities.
