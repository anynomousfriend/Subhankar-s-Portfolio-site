        I'm a finance student turned self-taught design professional with 3
        years of experience, now expanding my skillset as a developer and
        passionate Linux user (arch btw). I previously worked as a UI/UX
        designer at a leading company, where I successfully delivered 16+
        projects spanning web3, DeFi, and healthcare sectors. In addition, I've
        completed 5 independent design projects as a freelancer, honing my
        creative and problem-solving abilities.
